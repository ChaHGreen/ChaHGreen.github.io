        <p>Groud Truth: left</p>
        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a whisk, which is typically made of metal and has a rigid structure designed to mix ingredients. The object on the right is a humidifier, which is usually made of plastic and has a structure that allows it to hold water and release moisture into the air. The humidifier's design includes a flexible water tank and a fan, which suggests that it can change shape slightly under normal conditions without breaking. The whisk, on the other hand, is designed to be rigid to effectively mix ingredients without bending or breaking. Therefore, the humidifier is more deformable than the whisk.</p>

        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a ceramic mug, and the object on the right is a dishwasher. Ceramic is a brittle material that is not easily deformable; it will typically break before it deforms. The dishwasher, on the other hand, is made of metal and plastic, materials that can bend and flex under pressure without breaking. Therefore, the dishwasher is more deformable than the ceramic mug.</p>

        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left appears to be a plate, which is typically made of ceramic or glass, materials known for their rigidity and lack of deformability. The object on the right seems to be a flashlight, which is likely made of plastic or metal, materials that can be more easily deformed under pressure. Considering the typical use and material properties of these objects, the flashlight is more likely to change shape under normal conditions without breaking or when external force is applied.</p>

        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a tin can, and the object on the right is a house/car key. The tin can is made of metal, which is generally rigid and does not deform easily. The key, on the other hand, is made of metal as well but has a structure that allows for some flexibility, such as the bow and the teeth of the key. However, the key is designed to be rigid enough to fit into a lock and turn without bending. Under normal conditions, the tin can would require more force to deform compared to the key, which can bend slightly under pressure. Therefore, the key is more deformable than the tin can.</p>

        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a measuring cup, typically made of plastic or glass, and the object on the right is a pen, which is likely made of plastic. The measuring cup is designed to hold liquids and measure their volume, which requires it to be rigid and maintain its shape. The pen, on the other hand, is designed to be held and written with, which allows for some flexibility in its structure. However, the pen's primary function does not require it to be highly deformable, and it is likely to be more rigid than the measuring cup. Therefore, the measuring cup is more likely to change shape under normal conditions without breaking or when external force is applied.</p>

        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a spoon, and the object on the right is a bottle. The spoon, being made of metal, is more rigid and less likely to deform under normal conditions. The bottle, depending on its material, could be made of glass or plastic, both of which can be more deformable than metal. However, the bottle's structure, with a narrow neck and a wider body, suggests that it is designed to hold liquid and maintain its shape, which means it is less likely to deform under normal conditions without breaking.</p>

        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a box of macaroni and cheese, which is made of cardboard and is rigid. The object on the right is a pitcher, which is typically made of plastic or glass and has a handle and spout that allow it to be deformed slightly when filled with liquid or when pressure is applied. Given that the pitcher is designed to hold and pour liquids, it is more likely to change shape under normal conditions without breaking, whereas the macaroni and cheese box is designed to be rigid and protect its contents.</p>
