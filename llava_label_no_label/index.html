        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a cooler. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose the lid of the cooler. The cooler itself is a large appliance that cannot be moved easily, but the lid can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as the lid of a cooler. It is made of plastic, which makes it non-rigid. The cooler lid is designed to be opened and closed, which involves a pulling or pushing motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the lid typically requires one hand. When the lid is opened or closed, the kinematic behavior is freeform as it can be moved freely in multiple directions.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a white plastic structure with a wire rack below it. Initially, it's unclear what specific object this might be. Based on the scene image, the object is identified as a refrigerator shelf. It is made of plastic and metal, which makes it rigid. The refrigerator shelf is designed to hold items inside the fridge. It can be slid out and back in, which involves a pulling or pushing motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the shelf typically requires one hand. The kinematic behavior, when the shelf is moved, is translation as it moves linearly along its track.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a large kitchen appliance with a control panel on the front. It is placed on a kitchen counter, and there are other kitchen items around it, such as a microwave and a cutting board. Based on the scene image, the object is identified as a kitchen appliance, possibly a toaster oven or a small oven. It is made of metal and plastic, making it rigid. The appliance is designed to be used for cooking or heating food items. Interacting with the appliance typically involves turning it on or off, adjusting the settings, and opening or closing the door, which requires one hand due to its size and design. The kinematic behavior is 'freeform' as the appliance can be moved in various directions during use.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a kitchen counter. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose a section of the counter where a person is standing. The counter itself is a large, flat surface that cannot be moved easily, but the section within the bounding box can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as a section of a kitchen counter. It is made of wood and laminate, making it rigid. The counter is designed to be used for food preparation and storage. Interacting with the counter typically involves placing items on it or taking them off, which requires one hand due to its size and design. The kinematic behavior is 'freeform' as the counter can be moved in various directions during use.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a kitchen counter. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose a section of the counter where a person is preparing food. The counter itself is a large, flat surface that cannot be moved easily, but the area within the bounding box can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as a section of a kitchen counter. It is made of wood or laminate, which makes it rigid. The counter is designed for food preparation and storage. Interacting with the counter typically involves placing items on it or taking them off, which requires one hand due to its size and design. The kinematic behavior is 'freeform' as the counter can be moved in various directions during use.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a refrigerator. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose the door of the refrigerator. The refrigerator itself is a large appliance that cannot be moved easily, but the door can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as the door of a refrigerator. It is made of metal and plastic, making it rigid. The refrigerator door is designed to be opened and closed, which involves a pulling or pushing motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the door typically requires one hand. When the door is opened or closed, the kinematic behavior is rotation around the hinges.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a microwave oven. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose the door of the microwave oven. The microwave itself is a large appliance that cannot be moved easily, but the door can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as the door of a microwave oven. It is made of glass and metal, making it rigid. The microwave door is designed to be opened and closed, which involves a pulling or pushing motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the door typically requires one hand. When the door is opened or closed, the kinematic behavior is rotation around the hinges.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a refrigerator. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose the door of the refrigerator. The refrigerator itself is a large appliance that cannot be moved easily, but the door can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as the door of a refrigerator. It is made of metal and plastic, making it rigid. The refrigerator door is designed to be opened and closed, which involves a pulling or pushing motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the door typically requires one hand. When the door is opened or closed, the kinematic behavior is rotation around the hinges.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a glass door. It is part of a larger structure, possibly a sliding glass door or a glass window. The glass door is designed to provide a clear view of the outside while allowing light to enter the room. Based on the scene image, the object is identified as a glass door. It is made of glass, which makes it non-rigid. The glass door is designed to be opened and closed, which involves a sliding motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the door typically requires two hands. The kinematic behavior is 'n/a' as the door is not rigid.<br></p>
