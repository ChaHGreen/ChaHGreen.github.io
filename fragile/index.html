        <p>Right Object: Mug</p>
        <p>Groud Truth: right</p>
        <p>Prediction: left</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a stapler, and the object on the right is a mug. The stapler is made of plastic and metal, which are materials that can be easily damaged if dropped or mishandled, especially the plastic parts which can crack or break. The mug, on the other hand, is made of ceramic, which is generally more durable and less likely to break under normal conditions unless it is dropped from a significant height or subjected to a strong impact. Therefore, the stapler is more fragile.</p>

        <p>Groud Truth: right</p>
        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a computer mouse, and the object on the right is a teapot. The computer mouse is made of plastic and has a relatively simple structure, which can be easily damaged if dropped or mishandled. The teapot, on the other hand, is made of glass and metal, materials that are generally more durable and can withstand more impact without breaking. However, the glass part of the teapot is more fragile than the metal, and if the teapot is dropped, the glass is likely to shatter. Therefore, considering the materials and the potential for damage, the teapot is more fragile than the computer mouse.</p>

        <p>Right Object: Candle</p>
        <p>Groud Truth: right</p>
        <p>Prediction: left</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a candle, and the object on the right is also a candle. Both candles are made of wax, which is a material that can be easily melted or broken if mishandled. However, the candle on the right is encased in a glass jar, which provides additional protection against external impacts. The candle on the left is not encased and is more exposed to potential damage. Therefore, the candle on the left is more fragile as it lacks the protective glass jar of the candle on the right.</p>

        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a knife, and the object on the right is a mug. The knife is made of metal, which is a hard and durable material, while the mug appears to be made of ceramic or porcelain, which can be brittle and prone to chipping or breaking if dropped or mishandled. Therefore, the mug is more fragile than the knife.</p>

        <p>Groud Truth: right</p>
        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a house/car key, which is typically made of metal and has a hard structure designed to withstand the wear and tear of daily use. The object on the right is a mobile phone, which is made of glass and metal components that are more susceptible to damage from drops, impacts, or pressure. Given the materials and typical use, the mobile phone is more fragile and would require more careful handling to avoid breaking or damaging it.</p>

        <p>Right Object: Mobile phone</p>
        <p>Groud Truth: left</p>
        <p>Prediction: right</p>
        <p>Reasoning: The object on the left is a pottery jar, and the object on the right is a mobile phone. Pottery is typically made from clay and is fired at high temperatures, which makes it relatively durable but can still be fragile if dropped or mishandled, as it can chip or break. The mobile phone, on the other hand, is made from materials like glass and metal, which are also fragile and can easily break or shatter upon impact. However, the mobile phone is designed to be more resilient due to its construction and the presence of protective cases. In normal conditions, the mobile phone is more likely to be damaged from external impact due to its glass screen and the potential for internal components to be affected. Therefore, the mobile phone is more fragile.</p>
