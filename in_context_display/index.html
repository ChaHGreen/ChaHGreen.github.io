        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a stack of white towels on top of a washing machine. The towels are neatly folded and stacked, suggesting they are ready for use. Based on the scene image, the object is identified as a stack of towels. They are made of fabric, which makes them non-rigid. The towels are designed to be used for drying hands or body after washing. Interacting with the towels typically involves picking them up or putting them down, which requires one hand due to their lightweight. The kinematic behavior is 'n/a' as the towels are not rigid.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a white plastic structure with a wire rack below it. Initially, it's unclear what specific object this might be. From the object crop image, a closer look reveals that it is a refrigerator shelf. Combining both observations from the scene image and the object crop, the object is identified as a refrigerator shelf. It is made of plastic and metal, which makes it rigid. The refrigerator shelf is designed to hold items inside the fridge. It can be slid out and back in, which involves a pulling or pushing motion. Due to its size and weight, interacting with the shelf typically requires one hand. The kinematic behavior, when the shelf is moved, is translation as it moves linearly along its track.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a white dresser. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose the top surface of the dresser. The dresser itself is a large piece of furniture that cannot be moved easily, but the top surface can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as the top surface of a white dresser. It is made of wood, which makes it rigid. The top surface is designed to hold items such as clothing, accessories, or decorative objects. Interacting with the top surface typically involves placing or removing items, which can be done with one hand due to its size and flat surface. The kinematic behavior is 'freeform' as the top surface can be moved freely in multiple directions.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a kitchen counter. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose a section of the counter where a bowl is placed. The counter itself is a large, flat surface that cannot be moved easily, but the bowl can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as a bowl placed on a kitchen counter. It is made of glass or ceramic, which makes it rigid. The bowl is designed to hold and store food items. Interacting with the bowl typically involves picking it up or putting it down, which requires one hand due to its size and weight. The kinematic behavior is 'n/a' as the bowl is not meant to be moved frequently.<br></p>

        <p>reasoning: In the scene image, the object within the green bounding box appears to be a part of a kitchen counter. Specifically, the bounding box seems to enclose a section of the counter where a person is cutting vegetables. The counter itself is a large, flat surface that cannot be moved easily, but the cutting board can be interacted with separately. Combining both observations from the scene image, the object is identified as a cutting board. It is made of wood, which makes it rigid. The cutting board is designed to be placed on the counter and used for cutting and chopping food items. Interacting with the cutting board typically involves placing it on the counter and using it to cut, which requires one hand due to its size and design. The kinematic behavior is 'freeform' as the cutting board can be moved in various directions during use.<br></p>
